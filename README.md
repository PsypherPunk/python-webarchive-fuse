python-webarchive-fuse
======================

Python implementation of a (W)ARC FUSE filesystem.

Uses [fusepy](https://github.com/terencehonles/fusepy) which is under active development, unlike [webarchive-fuse](https://github.com/ukwa/webarchive-fuse) which depends on the seemingly defunct [fuse-j](http://fuse-j.sourceforge.net/).
